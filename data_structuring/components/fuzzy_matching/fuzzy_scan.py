"""
This module contains classes for fuzzy string matching and fuzzy match results.

Fuzzy string matching is a technique used to find similar strings. It allows for a certain amount of
typos or errors in the input string. The most common technique is the Levenshtein distance, which
computes the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions and substitutions) to transform
one string into another.

FuzzyMatchResult is a class that represents a single match. It contains the start and end indices of
the matched string within the original string, the matched string itself, the possibility (the string
that was searched for), the distance between the two strings and a list of flags that were raised
for this match.

The module also contains a class FuzzyMatch that makes use of the `fuzzysearch` and `rapidfuzz`
libraries to perform fuzzy string matching.
